## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project demonstrates the use of Java Swing for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Graphical interface with Java Swing
- Interactive gameplay with click events
- Real-time game status updates
